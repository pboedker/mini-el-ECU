# mini-el-ECU
Arduino Control Unit for the 'mini-el' three-wheeler electric vehicle.

This file will serve as the general entry point for the project. Hopefully, it will give any newcomers a rough idea of what the project is about and in combination with the open issues explain where it's at. 


Also, this project contains the hardware and schematics for mounting the Arduino inside the original dashboard using as much of the original user interface as possible.
